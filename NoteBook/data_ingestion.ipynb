The current health care\\nsystem provides enormous benefits, but there are substantial opportunities\\nfor reforms that would reduce costs, increase access, enhance quality, and\\nimprove the health of Americans.\\nAn individual’s health can be maintained or improved in many ways,\\nincluding through changes in personal behavior and through the appropriate\\nconsumption of health care services. While there is substantial health care\\nspending in the United States, the importance of health does provide a strong\\nrationale for this level of spending. But because health care financing and\\ndelivery are often inefficient, there are opportunities to advance health and\\naccess to health care services without further growth in spending. To improve\\nthe efficiency of health care financing and delivery, the Administration has\\npursued policies that would increase incentives for individuals to purchase\\nconsumer-directed health insurance plans. The Administration has also\\nworked to link provider payments to performance, thus rewarding efficient\\ndelivery of health care. In the President’s State of the Union Address,\\nhe proposed changing the tax treatment of health insurance, offering all\\nAmericans a standard deduction for buying health insurance. Such a change\\ncould play an important role in increasing the efficiency of the American\\nhealth care system and expanding health insurance coverage.\\nThe key points in this chapter are:\\n• Health can be improved not only through the consumption of health\\ncare services, but also through individual behavior and lifestyle choices\\nsuch as quitting smoking, eating more nutritious foods, and getting\\nmore exercise.\\n• Health care has enhanced the health of our population; greater efficiency\\nin the health care system, however, could yield even greater health for\\nAmericans without increasing health care spending.\\n• Rapid growth in health care costs and limited access to health insurance\\ncontinue to present challenges to the health care system.\\n• Administration policies focus on reducing cost growth, improving\\nquality, and expanding access to health insurance through an emphasis\\non private sector and market-based solutions.\\n97\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 9977 22//55//0088 11::2222::3311 PPMM\\n'),\n",

For example, demand for an MP3 player is based\\non the enjoyment that an MP3 player brings to a consumer, but few would\\nchoose to get a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the same reason. Rather, a\\nconsumer’s desire to have her gallbladder removed is directly related to the\\npositive impact the operation is likely to have on her health. Understanding\\nhow health is produced, demanded, and valued is a useful starting point for\\nevaluating the health care system and health care policy.\\nDemand for Health\\nPeople demand health because of its role in facilitating and providing\\nhappiness. Health can be defined along two dimensions: the length of life\\n(longevity) and the quality of life. A person derives value from the quality of\\nlife directly and indirectly: directly because one’s level of health affects the\\nenjoyment of goods and leisure and indirectly because one’s level of health\\nenhances productivity (Box 4-1). Enhanced productivity can be rewarded\\nin the labor market through higher wages. The indirect effect of health\\non productivity suggests that health is an important component of human\\ncapital investment. Consistent with the basic principle of our economic\\nsystem, consumers exercise choice in purchasing health care and other goods\\nand services.\\nThe Production of Health\\nHealth care is only one of the factors that determine health. Other factors\\ninclude individual behaviors, environmental factors, social factors, education,\\nincome, and genetics. If we think of an individual as a producer of health,\\nthe key production inputs are the time and money spent on health-improving\\nactivities and health care. Health-improving activities can include individual\\nchoices regarding exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle. Health care can include\\nhospital care, outpatient visits to medical providers, nursing home care, and\\nmedication. Because health can deteriorate from accidents, sudden disease,\\nand the effects of aging, health care inputs are needed not only to maintain\\ncurrent levels of health but also possibly to restore health following an illness\\nor injury.\\n98 | Economic Report of the President\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 9988 22//55//0088 11::2222::3311 PPMM\\n'),\n",

Absenteeism, not being present at the place of work as a result\\nof injury or illness, prevents an individual from contributing to output,\\nand may also affect the ability of coworkers to be productive when tasks\\nrequire collaboration. Presenteeism is the loss of at-work productivity\\ncaused by a lack of physical or mental energy needed to complete\\ntasks, increased workplace accidents, and the possible spread of illness\\nto fellow employees. There is evidence that both of these factors are\\ncostly. According to the Current Population Survey (CPS), 2.3 percent of\\nworkers will have an absence from work during a typical week due to\\ninjury or illness. Several studies estimating the extent to which presen-\\nteeism affects productivity indicate that, on average, the productivity\\nloss caused by some of the most common conditions (such as allergies,\\ndepression, musculoskeletal pain, and respiratory disorders) is between\\n5 and 18 percent.\\nInvestment in improving and managing health offers opportunities\\nto mitigate some of these costs. An increasing number of employers\\nare instituting at-work wellness programs that provide targeted health\\nmanagement. These programs range from monetary penalties for those\\nwith unhealthy lifestyles (such as smoking or uncontrolled diabetes) to\\nsubsidizing access to exercise facilities. The benefits are shared by the\\nworker (higher earnings, better quality of life) and the employer (enhanced\\nproductivity and decreased health care expenditures). Evidence of the\\nsuccess of these programs, while incomplete and variable, suggests\\nthat at-work wellness programs can improve worker health outcomes\\nand provide a positive return to employers. One long-term study of a\\nparticularly comprehensive wellness program shows that health care\\nexpenditures fell by an average of $225 per employee per year (mostly\\ndue to fewer doctor visits and hospital stays), but it took several years\\nto realize these benefits.\\nStudies of trends in health-improving activities show a mixed picture on\\nwhether Americans are investing more in their health. A recent study finds\\nthat Americans are smoking less and controlling their cholesterol and blood\\npressure better (through a combination of health-improving activities and\\nmedical inputs). In contrast, there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in\\nthe United States in both adults and children during the past few decades.\\nObesity has more than doubled since the late 1970s, from 15 percent to\\n34 percent among adults.

In 2006, Americans spent over $7,000 per capita on health care,\\nup from $2,400 in 1980 and $800 in 1960 (all in 2006 dollars).

Health care costs will pose an increasing challenge\\nfor consumers of health care and health insurance as expenditures in this sector\\nmake up a greater share of household consumption. Taxpayers will also face an\\nincreasing challenge as the budgetary burden of Federal and State health care\\nprograms continues to expand. (See Box 4-2 for an overview of government\\nhealth care programs.) Reducing health care cost growth and increasing access\\nwhile improving health care quality are the goals of Federal health care policy.\\nThe Administration’s objective has been to develop market-oriented policies to\\nmeet these goals by fostering the innovation, flexibility, and choice that are the\\nbest aspects of the American health care system. Market-oriented policies must\\naddress potential market failures that are at the root of the challenges in the\\nhealth care system. These problems include insufficient information available\\nto patients, health providers, and insurers; access barriers for lower-income\\nor disadvantaged Americans; and two specific market failures that arise in\\ninsurance markets: moral hazard and adverse selection. Moral hazard is the\\ntendency for individuals to overuse certain types of health care when insurance\\ncovers a sizable fraction of the costs; adverse selection is the tendency for\\ninsurance to be purchased by those persons who are most likely to need it (and\\nwho thus have higher costs). Policies aimed at mitigating these problems can\\nenhance the ability of our market-oriented health care system to achieve the\\ngoals of controlled cost growth, improved access to health insurance coverage,\\nand high-quality health care.\\nBox 4-2: Government Health Care Programs\\nAbout 46 percent of health care spending is funded by Federal and\\nState Governments through various health programs. The main govern-\\nment-funded health programs are designed to serve specific populations\\nand include Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children’s Health Insurance\\nProgram (SCHIP), and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).\\nMedicare was enacted in 1965 and covers nearly all individuals aged\\n65 and older (as well as some younger individuals with disabilities or\\nspecific illnesses). Medicare today consists of three basic parts.

Unlike other parts of Medicare, Part D is administered by a\\npartnership between private insurers and Medicare officials to provide\\nchoice of prescription drug plans to beneficiaries and to allow for price\\ncompetition. Part B and Part D are funded by a combination of premiums\\nfrom beneficiaries and government revenues (Part D also receives some\\nresources from the States). In 2007, there were 43.4 million beneficiaries\\nenrolled in Part A, 40.6 million in Part B, and 24.4 million in Part D.\\nUnder Fee-for-Service Medicare, health care providers are reimbursed\\nby the Federal Government at predetermined rates for services\\nprovided. However, Medicare beneficiaries can opt to enroll in a private\\nMedicare plan under Medicare Advantage through local coordinated\\ncare plans offered mostly by local health maintenance organizations\\n(HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs), regional PPOs, and\\nprivate fee-for-service providers. Local coordinated care plans make up\\n72 percent, regional PPO plans 3 percent, and private fee-for-service\\nplans 21 percent of Medicare Advantage plans.\\nMedicaid was also established in 1965 as a health care program for\\nlow-income individuals, in particular those with children.

The VHA is a truly public health\\ncare system in the sense that the Federal Government owns the VHA\\nhospitals and employs the health care providers.\\nRising health care costs are creating budget pressures for govern-\\nment health care programs. Currently, Federal spending on Medicare\\nand Medicaid totals about 4 percent of GDP, or about 20 percent of the\\nFederal budget. Rising health care costs, however, will likely raise those\\nfigures in coming decades.

Such spending growth, if it came to pass,\\nwould require either unprecedented levels of taxation or dramatic reduc-\\ntions in other government activities.\\nMoral Hazard and Cost Control\\nIn most markets, consumers decide what to purchase by comparing the\\nbenefit of a good or service relative to its cost. In the health care sector,\\nhowever, consumers often do not learn the prices of goods and services until\\nbills are received weeks or months later. Because health insurance polices\\ncover most health care costs, including the costs of routine, predictable health\\ncare services, consumers have little incentive to try to access and act on price\\ninformation. This moral hazard effect encourages overuse of certain types of\\nheath care, gives little incentive for consumers to consider costs in their search\\nfor a provider, and distorts incentives for technological change.\\nOveruse of health care can occur when the perceived cost of a service is less\\nthan the actual cost and, as a result, the service may be used even when its value\\nis less than its cost. This happens, for example, with health insurance coverage\\nthat shields consumers from the true cost of a service by having them pay none\\nor only a portion of its cost. To illustrate, consider a consumer’s decision to\\npurchase a migraine therapy that costs $100 to produce. If the symptoms are\\nserious enough and would be relieved by the therapy, the consumer might\\nbe willing to pay more than $100 for the therapy. The consumer would thus\\npurchase the therapy regardless of how much of the $100 cost was covered by\\ninsurance, and the purchase would not be overconsumption. If the customer\\nhad milder symptoms, however, insurance may induce overconsumption.\\nSuppose, for example, that the consumer would only be willing to pay $25 to\\nrelieve the symptoms. If insurance covered the entire $100 cost, the consumer\\nwould purchase the therapy since the $25 benefit exceeds the consumer’s\\n106 | Economic Report of the President\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 110066 22//55//0088 11::2222::3322 PPMM\\n'),\n",

Even if a $10 copayment was required by the insurance\\nbenefit, the purchase would still take place. Because the social cost of $100\\nexceeds the $25 benefit, this purchase would not be socially beneficial and\\nwould therefore be considered overconsumption.\\nBecause consumers are less sensitive to the prices of the health care services\\nthey consume, the competitive forces that typically keep prices down are\\nweakened. Imagine two hospitals that provide the same service, but hospital\\nA charges $1,000 and is located in an older facility, while hospital B charges\\n$2,000 but is located in an updated facility with a wide array of amenities\\nand equipment on site. Given these choices, a consumer facing the actual\\nprice may prefer hospital A, but in a world where few costs are shared with\\nthe patient, most people would choose hospital B. This gives hospital B few\\nincentives to control costs given that convenience or amenities have a greater\\ninfluence on consumer choice than price.\\nNew technological innovations enter a market in which consumers rarely\\npay more than 10 to 20 percent of the market price out-of-pocket. This influ-\\nences the value of the innovations that are developed and marketed. If a new\\nproduct is only slightly more effective than an existing product, for example,\\nit may be highly demanded even if it is priced well above existing alternatives.\\nBecause there is a market for new technology with little additional benefit\\nover existing treatments, innovators have sufficient incentive to create new\\ntechnologies with little marginal value.\\nHealth insurers and their sponsors (employers) recognize that insurance\\nreduces consumer incentives to be responsive to costs. Insurers use a variety\\nof cost-control mechanisms such as utilization review, pre-approval, and drug\\nformularies to attempt to manage costs and, in part, counteract the lack of cost\\nconsciousness by consumers. But those mechanisms can only partly offset the\\nproblem. In addition, insurance benefits are designed to limit moral hazard\\nby sharing the costs of services received with the beneficiary. Design features\\nto accomplish this goal include deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.\\nDeductibles, the dollar amount that a consumer will have to pay before the\\ninsurer pays for any medical expenses, are often less than $500. Copayments\\nare a fixed fee paid per visit or per prescription. Coinsurance is a percentage of\\nthe cost of the service that is the responsibility of the consumer.\\nThese cost sharing mechanisms are underutilized because of a bias created\\nby the tax code. The health insurance premium of employees paid by\\nemployers is exempt from income and payroll taxes, but individual spending\\nthrough deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance is taxable. As a result, there\\nis a tax incentive for employers to compensate employees through generous\\nhealth insurance plans that limit cost sharing. Thus, the tax code reduces\\nthe incentive for optimal health insurance design and ultimately encourages\\nindividuals to purchase more health care services than they would otherwise.\\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs), enacted into law by this Administration\\nChapter 4 | 107\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 110077 22//55//0088 11::2222::3322 PPMM\\n'),\n",

These policies are intended to offer the\\nprivate sector more opportunities to control costs through greater consumer\\nawareness of the cost of health insurance premiums and health care services.\\nHealth Savings Accounts\\nHealth Savings Accounts are savings accounts of pre-tax dollars, funded\\nby individual or employer contributions, that can be used toward current\\nand future out-of-pocket medical expenses. HSAs are designed to be used\\nin conjunction with high-deductible health plans, reducing reliance on\\ninsurance for routine health expenses. The funds in the HSA can be used to\\npay these routine health expenses directly. Because unspent funds belong to\\nthe individual and can accumulate over time, HSAs lead the individual to\\nplay a more active role as a health care consumer. In January 2007, HSAs\\ncovered 4.5 million people, which is an increase of 1.3 million since January\\n2006, and 3.5 million since March 2005.\\nAs the consumer plays a greater role and becomes more aware of routine\\nhealth expenses, provision of inefficient care should be reduced; incentives for\\nproviders to adopt cost-effective therapies should increase; and possibly, some\\nhealth care prices may decline, which may even benefit consumers in tradi-\\ntional insurance plans. Yet the benefit of moving to a high-deductible policy\\nwith an HSA will vary in that chronically ill individuals with persistently high\\nspending may find these policies less desirable because their out-of-pocket\\nspending would be consistently high. Consumers in lower tax brackets will\\nderive a smaller tax benefit from HSAs because the value of tax exemption\\ndepends on a consumer’s marginal tax rate (the tax paid on the next dollar a\\nworker earns).\\nA Standard Deduction for Health Insurance to Replace the\\nTax Exemption\\nThe lack of consumer sensitivity to health care prices occurs not just\\nthrough the consumption of health care services, but through the consump-\\ntion of health insurance as well. The tax exemption of employer-sponsored\\nhealth insurance premiums is inefficient because, by providing a larger tax\\nbreak to families with more-generous employer-sponsored health insurance\\npolicies, there is an incentive for health insurance to cover more services than\\nemployees would otherwise demand. This occurs because employees can\\nincrease after-tax compensation by accepting more of their compensation in\\nthe form of health insurance.\\nThe President has proposed to replace the current open-ended tax exclusion\\nfor employment-based health insurance with a flat $15,000 standard\\n108 | Economic Report of the President\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 110088 22//55//0088 11::2222::3322 PPMM\\n'),\n",

The first effect can be shown\\nin the following example. Consider a family of four with an annual income of\\n$50,000 and a health insurance policy worth $10,000 that is sponsored by an\\nemployer. Because the marginal tax rate of this family is roughly 30 percent,\\nthe current tax exemption for the cost of this insurance policy provides a\\n$3,000 tax break to the family.

An uninsured family of four earning $50,000, for example, would\\nreceive a tax benefit of $4,500 if they purchased health insurance in the\\nindividual market (the value of the $15,000 standard deduction if the family\\nfaces a 30 percent marginal tax rate). That tax break would cover nearly half\\nthe cost of a family health insurance plan costing $10,000.\\nThe availability of a tax deduction for the purchase of health insurance for\\nindividuals and families who are not offered employer-sponsored coverage\\nwill make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. The\\nAdministration estimates that the standard deduction would provide 3 to\\n5 million individuals with health insurance who did not have it previously.\\nEven with a standard deduction, challenges for affordable coverage remain\\nfor individuals with low incomes or with substantial risk of high health\\nexpenditures. The Administration’s Affordable Choices Initiative addresses\\nthese remaining challenges. The initiative facilitates State efforts to make\\nhealth insurance more affordable for individuals with persistently high\\nmedical expenses or limited incomes. Currently, subsidies and payments from\\nthe Federal Government are funneled through providers; the objective is to\\nredirect funding toward individuals.\\nControlling Costs Through Competitive\\nInsurance Markets\\nThe effective functioning of a competitive marketplace for health insurance\\nrequires addressing adverse selection. Adverse selection arises when insurance\\nis most attractive to those persons most likely to need it. If the premium is\\nbased on the population average and the policy disproportionately attracts\\nthose who spend more than the average, the policy will lose money for the\\ninsurer. The policy will then either increase in price or not last in the market.\\nIn the extreme, some consumers do not purchase insurance because the only\\npolicy available to them is priced for the most expensive consumers.\\nThe problems can be most severe in insurance markets involving small\\nfirms and individuals without access to group coverage, because large risk\\npools mitigate many of the forces that can lead to adverse selection. (However,\\nadverse selection can arise in broad risk pools when competing health plan\\nchoices are made available.) To varying degrees, States can minimize adverse\\nselection by permitting providers in the market for individual insurance to\\nrate each individual on the basis of his or her medical risk and past health care\\nexpenditure. As a consequence, individuals with chronic illnesses have to pay\\nhigher premiums, be denied coverage altogether, or be denied coverage for\\nthe condition which is making them ill.\\n110 | Economic Report of the President\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 111100 22//55//0088 11::2222::3322 PPMM\\n'),\n",

These regulations generally include guaranteed issue\\nlaws that require insurers to issue insurance to any eligible applicant without\\nregard to current health status or other factors, and community rating laws\\nthat prohibit insurers from varying premium rates based on health status and\\nrestrict the amount by which insurers are allowed to vary rates based on char-\\nacteristics such as age or gender. Although these regulations tend to reduce\\ninsurance premiums for high-risk individuals, they also increase premiums\\nfor lower risk individuals. Those premium increases can have the unintended\\nconsequence of encouraging people to wait until they have a health problem\\nbefore enrolling. If such adverse selection reduces participation of healthier\\npeople, premiums will increase and the voluntary insurance market may cease\\nto operate effectively. The result may be less insurance coverage and only\\nlimited premium reductions for those who are chronically ill, as those who are\\nhealthier choose to forgo coverage entirely rather than pay higher premiums.\\nThe approach of the Administration is one that encourages lower premiums\\nparticularly in the individual and small group markets, where adverse\\nselection poses the greatest challenges for competitive insurance markets.\\nThe Administration supports a national market for health insurance rather\\nthan State-specific markets. This would effectively make insurance available\\nto individuals and small groups under conditions that resemble those now\\navailable to employees of many large corporations, which, by self-insuring,\\nare exempt from State insurance regulations and instead operate under the\\nFederal insurance law provisions of the Employee Retirement and Income\\nSecurity Act (ERISA). Health insurance policies with lower premiums would\\nbe more readily available because health insurance policies would not be\\nsubject to costly State mandates and regulations.

A recent example is eliminating payments for negative\\nconsequences of care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\\n(CMS) implemented a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which\\nprevents Medicare from giving hospitals higher payment for the additional\\ncosts of treating certain “hospital-acquired conditions”—conditions that\\nresult from medical errors or improper care and that can reasonably be\\nexpected to be averted. Now big insurers are following Medicare’s lead and\\nare moving to ban payments for care resulting from grave mistakes. These\\nchanges remove a perverse incentive for hospitals: improving patient safety\\ncould reduce revenues and profits. As a result, these reforms should trigger\\nsafety improvements and enhance the efficiency of the health care system.\\nTransparency of Price and Quality Information\\nTransparency of information on price and quality has been a priority of\\nthis Administration. Medicare has provided incentives to providers to submit\\nperformance information to CMS and many of these performance measures\\nhave been made available on the CMS website so that consumers can compare\\nthe quality of providers as they seek care. The administrators and sponsors of\\nMedicare and other Federal health insurance programs have been directed to\\nshare with beneficiaries information about prices paid to health care providers\\nand the quality of the services they deliver. The commitment is to transform\\nMedicare by always seeking to improve the connection between expenditures\\nand positive health outcomes without increasing Medicare spending.\\nPromoting Healthy Behavior\\nEncouraging healthy behaviors, such as exercising more, eating better,\\ncontrolling weight gain, and quitting smoking, may be a cost-effective alter-\\nnative to increased spending on health care. One way to encourage healthy\\nbehavior is through health education. For example, much of the beneficial\\neffect of prenatal care is simply related to education about healthy behavior\\nwhile pregnant. A better understanding of the risks of high cholesterol and\\nblood pressure (and how to reduce those risks through healthy behavior) is\\ncredited with being a very highly efficient way to improve health outcomes.\\nAdministration policies that aim to increase consumer sensitivity to health\\nChapter 4 | 113\\ncchhaapptteerr44..iinndddd 111133 22//55//0088 11::2222::3333 PPMM\\n'),\n",

Addressing these fundamental problems and fulfilling\\nthe potential of our health care system will require innovative polices to help\\nAmericans get the care that best meets their needs, and to create an environment\\nthat rewards high-quality, efficient care.

Efficiency of health spending would be improved if tax\\ncode reforms were enacted. Reforms could level the playing field between\\nemployer-provided and individual health insurance, thus boosting insurance\\ncoverage. At the same time, reforms could reward consumers for purchases of\\nhigher deductible plans with reasonable copayments that provide insurance\\nfor costly medical necessities, but do not encourage unwarranted procedures.\\nBy addressing concerns of adverse selection, insurance markets can become\\nmore competitive, thereby promoting innovation, choice, access, and\\nefficiency.

Even the amount of documenta-\\ntion required during a hospital stay can be quite lengthy, which can make it difficult\\nto locate specific data critical to drug therapy selection and assessment of patient\\nresponse. Compounding these issues is the fact that every institution and clinic has a\\ndifferent method for organizing patients’ medical information.\\nBecause most encounters with patients occur over more than one point in time,\\nthe use of a medical record facilitates the documentation of all data collected over\\ntime. In both the hospital and clinic settings, the medical record takes the form of\\na patient chart composed of printed materials in a folder or binder (paper-based\\nchart) or within a computer system (electronic medical record), or a combination of\\nthe two. Regardless of the system used by an institution or clinic, the general order\\nof the medical record is similar, as shown in table 2.1. Depending upon the indi-\\nvidual patient’s characteristics, the inpatient medical record can be quite lengthy,\\nespecially when there are numerous comorbidities or complications that require a\\nlong hospitalization. Similarly, the outpatient medical record can become exten-\\nsive when a patient has had numerous encounters with the practitioner over many\\nyears’ time. Developing familiarity with where to find vital pieces of information\\nmakes the development of an assessment and plan more efficient and effective. The\\nfirst step is understanding the contents contained within each component of the\\nmedical record.\\ncOmpOnents Of a patient’s medicaL recOrd\\nThe medical record can be dissected into five primary components, including the\\nmedical history (often known as the history and physical, or h&p), laboratory\\nand diagnostic test results, the problem list, clinical notes, and treatment notes.1,2\\nSubheadings for each component are located in Table 2.1.

Subsequent healthcare needs or problems are listed in descending order of prior-\\nity or severity; these typically include chronic medical conditions contained within the\\nPMH, abuse of substances noted in the social history, drug-related problems identified\\nwith current or past medications, laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities identified\\nupon admission, and so on.\\nNumerous practitioners will document problem lists within the medical record.\\nFor an inpatient, the admitting practitioner, nurse, pharmacist, nutritionist, respira-\\ntory therapist, and physical therapist may each have their own prioritized list of needs\\nwithin the chart, overlapping in some ways and unique in others. From these, it is\\npossible to create a comprehensive list that addresses all of the issues at hand. For an\\noutpatient, the attending practitioner may develop a list at the end of his or her note,\\naddressing those issues of highest priority. For both inpatients and outpatients, prac-\\ntitioners will often document their plans for each need, including a differential diag-\\nnosis, treatments being considered or administered, and a plan for patient education.\\nRegardless of location, it is important to note that the problem list is dynamic.\\nIt can change from day to day for an inpatient or from visit to visit for an outpa-\\ntient.

This approach usually involves the use of a paper-based or\\nelectronic form that has enough space to include all of the relevant material that the\\npharmacist may need to collect. These forms are often developed or tailored to meet\\nthe needs of a specific pharmacist with a designated set of patient care responsibilities\\nand may be formatted to mirror the order in which the pharmacist will either collect\\nor interpret the data.\\nThe benefits of a systematic approach are numerous. First, it allows the phar-\\nmacist to routinely organize information pertinent to the pharmaceutical care of the\\npatient in a consistent manner. Second, systematic data collection allows the phar-\\nmacist to maintain a process during which potential drug-related problems may be\\nevaluated. Third, this approach allows for ease of patient care “pass-off” should the\\npharmacist transfer care of a patient to another pharmacist. Additionally, the phar-\\nmacist’s collected data may become a resource for reporting on patient care during\\nrounds, facilitating discussion with other healthcare practitioners, or documenting\\nclinical interventions.\\ninitiating the systematic approach to data collection\\nA primary goal of systematically collecting data from the patient record should be to\\nkeep the process simple yet relevant and comprehensive enough for a pharmacist’s\\nneeds. A key in this process is not to overcollect data because it is available, but to\\nbe sure that there is a use and a reason for each type of data being collected. Because\\nthis may become a routine activity as a part of patient care, efficiency and consistency\\nin collection of data become important. For example, a pharmacist may have many\\npatients under his or her immediate care and may need to review data on each of\\nthese patients.\\nTiming of patient data collection usually follows a three-point approach: a\\npreencounter assessment, a mid-encounter assessment, and a postencounter assess-\\nment. Regardless of the setting, the role of the pharmacist in the preencounter\\nassessment is often to gather data relevant to the care of the patient for a given\\ntask (e.g., clinic visit, patient care rounds), and this is typically conducted prior to\\nmeeting with the patient or provider team. Data can then be updated or augmented\\nduring the mid-assessment encounter with the patient based on additional findings\\nor the patient interview. Finally, monitoring and follow-up of new or changed data\\nshould occur, and the data collection form updated accordingly in the postencoun-\\nter assessment.\\n'),\n",

Depending upon the patient care responsibilities of the individual\\npharmacist, the pertinent pharmacy-related components of a patient’s chart may vary.\\nFor example, an infectious diseases clinical pharmacist may dive right into the chart to\\nseek out antibiotic orders and laboratory data for serum drug concentrations and renal\\nfunction assessments, whereas a cardiology pharmacy specialist may initially search for\\nblood pressure values from the physical examination in order to assess the effectiveness of\\na patient’s antihypertensive drug regimen. Regardless of specialty or focus, several general\\npharmacy-related components are contained within each portion of the medical record.\\nmedical history\\nThe medical history (H&P) is a key area for identifying drug-related problems, which\\nwill be discussed at length in the final section of this chapter. Thus, the majority of\\ninformation contained within the H&P is valuable in developing an assessment and\\nplan for interventions to optimize pharmacotherapy. The pharmacist may find data\\nlacking in some areas, which will require clarification via additional patient interview-\\ning. For example, a patient’s chart may indicate an allergy to penicillin, but the specific\\nreaction not be identified.

These require\\nthe pharmacist to perform the appropriate assessment technique to obtain and docu-\\nment the finding. For example, the physical examination of a patient who presents\\nto the hospital with nausea and vomiting resulting from phenytoin toxicity should\\nnote the presence or absence of nystagmus, a finding associated with supratherapeu-\\ntic serum concentrations of the drug. If this information is not found in the medical\\nrecord, the pharmacist should perform the appropriate assessment (in this case, the\\nH test to assess for nystagmus) and document the finding accordingly.\\nThroughout the H&P, the pharmacist can identify pertinent positive and nega-\\ntive components that are key to the development of an assessment and plan. This\\nbecomes especially important when gathering data from the HPI, ROS, and PE. The\\nimportance of pertinent positives can be easily rationalized, while pertinent negatives\\nare not so obvious. For example, if the family history of a 39-year-old man presenting\\nto the emergency department with a myocardial infarction indicates no family history\\nof coronary artery disease, it is a pertinent negative fact to note on the data collec-\\ntion form, because it might be expected that someone in the patient’s family would\\nhave preexisting cardiac disease. Another example would be a patient presenting with\\npneumonia who has no shortness of breath (SOB). The pharmacist should document\\n“no SOB” in the ROS of this patient, because it is a pertinent finding for this patient.\\nA large majority of the H&P is relevant to the pharmacist’s data collection.\\nLaboratory and diagnostic test results\\nIn the lab section, pharmacists can focus on a number of pharmacy-related data points,\\nincluding labs reflecting effects of disease states and medications on organ systems\\n(e.g., serum creatinine, liver function tests, CBC, urinalysis), serum drug concentra-\\ntions (e.g., vancomycin, phenytoin, digoxin), and cultures. Again, pertinent negative\\nvalues are important to document, because some patients may have some unexpectedly\\nnormal labs (e.g., normal liver function tests in a patient with a history of liver disease).\\nDiagnostic test results become important for the pharmacist to gather in order to\\nunderstand the status of the patient’s various healthcare needs. Again, normal results\\nof diagnostic tests can be just as valuable as abnormal results (e.g., normal electrocar-\\ndiogram in a patient with chest pain) and thus should be recorded by the pharmacist\\non the data collection form.\\n'),\n",

It is critical to collect all pertinent information\\nfrom the medical record in order to create a thorough and complete assessment, prob-\\nlem list, and plan for an individual patient. It can be frustrating to search the chart for\\na piece of information and not find it where it should likely be. Several issues can arise\\nwhen navigating the choppy waters of the medical record.\\nmissing details\\nDetails are often missed during the documentation of the PMH. For example,\\na patient who is HIV positive should have the year of diagnosis and the most recent\\nviral load and CD4 T-cell counts listed. The chart of a patient with diabetes, for\\nexample, should have the type of diabetes documented (i.e., type 1 or type 2) as well\\nas any associated complications (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy).\\nIf these clarifying details are missing, they can often be located in other areas of the\\nchart, including H&Ps from previous admissions or visits, previous lab studies, and\\neven from interviewing the patient.\\n'),\n",

This most commonly\\nseems to occur with the review of systems and the physical exam. It is important to\\nremember that the ROS is not the PE; inexperienced practitioners may inadvertently\\ndocument a physical finding in the ROS section, or vice versa. For example, shortness\\nof breath may be documented in the pulmonary part of the PE, when it should be\\nlocated in the respiratory system part of the ROS, because it is a symptom subjectively\\nperceived and reported by the patient. This occasionally occurs with FH and SH;\\ninexperienced providers may place information regarding marital status in the FH\\nsection, for example. When navigating a patient’s chart, the reader must be aware of\\nthe potential for misclassification of data and ensure that the data are properly placed\\non the data collection sheet.\\nconflicting information\\nConflicting information may become an issue when multiple practitioners perform\\nH&Ps on the same patient. For example, the PE performed by the medical stu-\\ndent may note that the patient’s breath sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally,\\nwhereas the resident physician has documented rales and rhonchi in the left lower\\nlobe of the lung. Clarification of conflicting information may require reviewing fur-\\nther information in the chart in addition to speaking with the team of practitioners\\ntaking care of the patient. Additionally, the pharmacist may interview the patient\\nand perform a physical assessment of the patient to determine a resolution for the\\nconflicting information.\\nLocating all of the information\\nOccasionally, it may be difficult to obtain a patient’s inpatient paper chart because it\\nis being used by another practitioner or because it is sent with the patient when he\\nor she leaves the medical floor for diagnostic testing (e.g., x-ray) or procedures (e.g.,\\nsurgery). When this occurs, information gathering can begin with using the electronic\\nmedical record system to gather laboratory and dictated information. Any informa-\\ntion that cannot be obtained in this manner can then be followed up on when the\\npaper chart becomes available. Additionally, there may be a high demand for computer\\nterminals on nursing floors or in a cramped ambulatory care clinic setting.

Several DRPs have been described:6–10\\n• Indication lacking a drug. Each diagnosis or indication should be reviewed\\nto determine the presence or absence of appropriate drug therapy, including\\nsynergistic or prophylactic drug therapy. Indications that need drug therapy,\\nyet are lacking in any or complete therapy, should be evaluated further. An\\nexample of this DRP includes a patient with a history of coronary artery disease\\nand hyperlipidemia who does not have any medications prescribed for hyper-\\nlipidemia. This DRP may also be observed in a patient with generalized anxi-\\nety disorder who has not received an antianxiety medication (e.g., a selective\\nserotonin-reuptake inhibitor, benzodiazepine, etc.).\\n• Indication with incorrect drug. Each diagnosis or indication should be\\nreviewed to determine if the therapy associated with it is effective or correct, not\\nonly with the drug itself, but also with the route of administration. Often, this\\nDRP warrants reevaluation as a disease progresses, patient tolerance increases,\\nor efficacy is not observed. An example of this type of DRP would be a patient\\ntreated with intravenous vancomycin for Clostridium difficile colitis. The route\\nof administration for vancomycin for this indication should be oral, because the\\nintravenous route is ineffective.\\n• Wrong dosage. This DRP incorporates a drug dose that may be too high or\\ntoo low. Both instances can alter the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic agent\\nand requires evaluation. Additionally, dose frequency and duration should\\nbe evaluated. For example, a patient who is HIV positive and who receives\\natazanavir 200 mg daily as a component of her antiretroviral drug regimen\\nwould have this DRP on her problem list, because this dose of atazanavir is\\ntoo low.\\n• Inappropriately receiving drug. This DRP may alternately be described\\nas the patient having problems with compliance or adherence to a particular\\nmedication or regimen. However, this DRP may also pertain to patient misun-\\nderstanding about how a specific drug should be taken or lack of availability of\\nthe agent, perhaps due to manufacturing availability issues or patient financial\\nissues. An example of this DRP would be a patient who misses 2 weeks of his\\ntreatment regimen for hepatitis C infection due to not receiving it in the mail\\nfrom his mail order pharmacy.\\n• adverse reaction to a drug. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) should be\\nassessed. If an offending agent is found, it may be discontinued.

This is especially important to assess when\\na patient is on medications with a high propensity for drug interactions, as in\\nthe case of a patient receiving rifampin for treatment of tuberculosis.\\n• Drug lacking indication. All drugs should be directly connected to a particular\\nindication. If an indication is not present or is no longer present for a specific\\ndrug, the patient may need to be weaned off the agent or discontinue it. For\\nexample, a patient receiving hydrochlorothiazide who does not have hyperten-\\nsion on his problem list and who denies having high blood pressure should have\\nthis DRP documented on his problem list.\\nDRPs can vary in nature and often arise from the disease states present on the\\npatient’s problem list. It is easy to become overwhelmed when trying to identify all of\\nthe DRPs for an individual patient. Thus, following an organized, stepwise process is\\nkey to ensuring that all DRPs are identified and prioritized properly.9 This organized\\napproach is summarized in table 2.4. Step 4 in Table 2.4 permits the pharmacist to\\nquickly recognize if a DRP exists with a particular medication. If the answer to any\\nof the first four questions is “no” or if the answer to the last question is “yes,” further\\ninvestigation to identify DRPs is necessary. Once all DRPs are identified, they can be\\nprioritized and merged into the problem list with the patient’s disease states.10\\nFor example, consider the following patient encounter. An otherwise healthy\\npatient arrives at the clinic after completing a trial of lifestyle changes for his recent\\ndiagnosis of hypertension. At this current visit, the patient’s blood pressure remains\\nelevated, and, along with the prescribing practitioner, the pharmacist agrees to help\\ndevelop a medication plan for this patient. The pharmacist reviews all necessary\\ndata, including the patient’s medical history, allergies, and contraindications, cur-\\nrent hypertension guidelines, and appropriate drug information, and suggests to the\\nprescriber that she initiate an antihypertensive medication at an appropriate starting\\ndose and frequency. The pharmacist documents the patient’s DRP as “indication lack-\\ning drug.” Note that this is different from the physician-diagnosed medical problem,\\nwhich would be “hypertension.” At follow-up visits with this patient, the pharmacist\\nwill likely assess the patient for additional potential DRPs, including potential nonad-\\nherence, drug interactions, and the presence of adverse drug reactions. If any of these\\nwere observed at the follow-up visit, the pharmacist could work with the prescribing\\npractitioner to prioritize existing DRPs and create a plan for each problem.\\n'),\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what PMH stands for based on the context provided. Let me read through it again to gather all the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context has several chunks about medical histories and past medical history (pMh). Chunk 1 mentions that pMh is a list of past and current medical conditions, including surgical history, hospitalizations, trauma, etc. Similarly, there are chunks for Family History and Social History, each detailing aspects like chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, dietary habits, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the question: \"what is PMH.\" The term appears in multiple chunks. In Chunk 1, it's defined as past medical history (pMh), which includes surgical history (PSH). But I also see another chunk where it says \"past Surgical History (PSH) is often included within PMH, as are previous hospitalizations, trauma, and obstetrical history (for female patients).\" So PSH is part of pMh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at other chunks, they refer to Family History and Social History. In those sections, they list medical conditions like chronic diseases, etc., which seems different from pMh. Also, for Social History, it mentions alcohol, tobacco use, etc., which are lifestyle factors, not medical history.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting this together: PMH is the general term that includes both past and current medical conditions. It's often broken down into components like surgical history, hospitalization details, trauma, obstetrical history, and family/child history. However, it doesn't include family health conditions or social history details about lifestyle factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in another part of the context, under \"and current medical conditions,\" they mention that past surgical history is often included within pMh. So PMH includes all previous medical history across different areas like surgery, hospitalizations, etc., while Fh refers to family-related conditions and Sh to personal lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to answer: PMH stands for Past Medical History.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "PMH stands for Past Medical History, which is a comprehensive list of past and current medical conditions. It includes surgical history, previous hospitalizations, trauma, and obstetrical information (for female patients). It encompasses family-related medical conditions, social details about lifestyle factors such as alcohol, tobacco use, and illicit drug use, dietary habits, exercise routines, and caf eeine use.\n"
